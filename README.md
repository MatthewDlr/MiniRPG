# MiniRPG Q&A

### 1/ How much time did I spend on this project?
According to my IDE, I have spent over 20 hours coding this.

### 2/ Is the game working in console mode?
Yes, the game is fully functional.

### 3/ Is the game working in UI mode?
Unfortunately, the game is not working in UI mode due to a huge difficulty in the Input Parser.
There is a working UI, but it will stop before the beginning of a fight.

### 4/ Is the UI will be functional one day?
Nope, the development has been dropped out to focus on other stuff such as the new game to develop.

### 5/ Is the Input Parser functional?
Yes! The Input parser is successfully working and redirect the output/input toward the chosen method. 
But this why the UI mode is lagging and has not been finished :/

### 6/ Is my code clean?
Nope, the code is visually horrible, hardly not optimized and surely unpleasant to read. 
One of the hardest things for me is to keep code clean over time and I failed at it, it's why my project feels like messy.

### 7/ Did I made unitary tests?
Not this time. Unitary tests are still blurry for me, and I struggled to figure out how implement them so I skipped them.
But I'm planning to developp my next project driven by tests development in order to fix this lack.

### 8/ Did I learn things?
A lot! Unlike some of my classmates, 100% of this code has been written by me (and only me, not my brother, a weird program neither an Indian YouTuber). 
This has led to a big understanding in Java structures of OOP and clarify so many things in my head.
I can't wait to put my all-new-fresh knowledge in a new project.

### 9/ Did I enjoy making this project?
I had to admit that it was frightening at the beginning when I saw all the work to do.
This project made me feel overwhelmed for a while and spoiled my pleasure a bit.
