# MiniRPG Q&A

### 1/ How much time did I spend on this projet?
According to my IDE, I past 20+ hours coding this.

### 2/ Is the game working in console mode?
Yes, the game is fully functional.

### 3/ Is the game working in UI mode?
Unforthunately, the game is not working in UI mode due to huge difficulty in the InputParser.

### 4/ Is the UI will be functional one day?
Nope, the developpment has been drop out to focus on other stuff stuch as the new game to develop

### 5/ Is the InputParser is functional?
Yes! The Input parser is successfuly working and redirect the outpout/input toward the chosen method. 
But this why the UI mode is lagging and has not been finished :/

### 6/ Is my code clean?
Nope, the code is visually horrible, hardly not optimized and surely unpleasant to read.

### 7/ Did I learn things?
A lot! Unlike some of my classmates, 100% of this code has been written by me (and only me, not by brother, a weird program netither an Indian youtuber). 
This has led to big understanding in Java structures in OOP and clarify so much things in my head.
I can't wait to put my all-new-fresh knowledge in a new project.

### 8/ Did I enjoy making this project?
Yes, but I have to admit that it was terryfying at the beginning when I saw the huge amount of things to do.
And I was overwelmed for a good part of this project.
